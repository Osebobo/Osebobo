Let me introduce myself :slightly_smiling_face: I am Oladimeji Adeyemi, as you all coding was my hobby and life style. I met coding at the very beginning of my academic career. Although I didn't pay much interest into it due to lack of resources and proper guidance. I have a Master's in Computer Science with focus in Machine Learning. I have a published paper :slightly_smiling_face: "Speed Breakers, Road Marking Detection and Recognition Using Image Processing Techniques". 
I'm self thought developer and my journey started fully in the year 2020.  I’m interested and currently learning Web development, Digital Marketing, UI/UX and Machine Learning / Data Science and also lookoing to collaborate on in the above mention interest. I am currently working at Crossknowledge Investments CC as a Web developer. I couldn't spare a lot of time for my personal development due to work but I think it's time to get more active in Github, follow me :metal:
